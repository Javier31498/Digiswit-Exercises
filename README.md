# Digiswit-Exercises
Public repository of Javier Torres Solís in terms of testing.

The purpose of this public repository is the workspace of Javier Torres Solís in relation to the elaboration of some exercises for Digiswit.

The app has been made in Intellij.
Languaje: Java

## INSTRUCTIONS OF THE APPLICATION
For the application to work, it is enough to execute the Main.java class. After following the console instructions, the user will choose between different options:

- Option 1: Exercise 1 - Find the second largest number in an array:

The user is going to enter a number to establish the size of the array. Then, the program will fill the array with random numbers between 1 and 1000. The program will sort the array in descending order with a class implementing a Quick Sort algorithm, and the second largest number will be displayed on the console for the user.
